# Data-Visualization_Tableau_Hans_Rosling: It is an attempt to create visluaization of Life Expectancy Vs GDP and Life Expectancy VS Fertility rate.
For all the countries by continent and respective population size over the years.
Data for Per Capita Income (GDP) Was taken from the below mentioned Link. https://www.gapminder.org/data/                                                                                

The data used were, countries by continent, Life expectancy, Fertility Rate and GDP. 
This visualization shows the dynamics of how number of children per household varies with the increase in life expectancy over the
years for different countries of the world and we have shown a positive correlation between income and life expectancy. 
We can conclude that with increase in income i.e. GDP of different countries, the life expectancy increases and with it there has
been a paradigm shift towards neuclear families.
